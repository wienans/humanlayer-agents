# Implement Structure Outline

You are tasked with implementing a structure outline from `.humanlayer/tasks/`. These outlines contain phases with file changes and validation steps.

## Getting Started

When given a task name or outline path:
1. Discover all documents: `ls -La .humanlayer/tasks/TASKNAME`
2. Read EVERY doc you find: ticket, research, prd, tdd, design discussion, outline
3. Read files fully — never use limit/offset parameters
4. Start implementing the specified phase

**Document precedence**: structure outline > tdd > prd > design discussion > research > ticket - if there is a conflict, the structure outline takes precedence

## Implementation Philosophy

Outlines describe intent and signatures. Your job is to:
- Write the actual implementation based on the outline's guidance
- Follow each phase's file changes systematically
- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context
- Update progress markers in the outline as you complete work

When things don't match the outline exactly, think about why and communicate clearly.

If you encounter a mismatch:
- STOP and think deeply about why the outline can't be followed
- Present the issue clearly:
  ```
  Issue in Phase [N]:
  Expected: [what the outline says]
  Found: [actual situation]
  Why this matters: [explanation]

  How should I proceed?
  ```

## Progress Tracking

**Update the outline document** as you complete work:

1. **Validation checkboxes**: When automated verification passes, update checkboxes:
   `- [ ] \`bun run typecheck\`` → `- [x] \`bun run typecheck\``

2. **Phase completion**: When ALL validation for a phase passes (automated AND manual confirmed), mark the phase title:
   `## Phase 1: Title` → `## ✅ Phase 1: Title`

Use the Edit tool to make these updates. This creates a persistent record of progress.

## Verification Approach

After implementing a phase:
1. Run all automated verification commands listed in the Validation section
2. Fix any issues before marking checkboxes complete
3. Update checkboxes in the outline using Edit
4. Update your `todowrite` progress
5. **Pause for human verification**: After automated checks pass, inform the human:
   ```
   Phase [N] Complete - Ready for Manual Verification

   Automated verification passed:
   - [List automated checks that passed]

   Please perform the manual verification steps listed in the outline:
   - [List manual verification items]

   Let me know when manual testing is complete so I can mark the phase complete.
   ```

Do not mark phase title with ✅ until the human confirms manual verification passed.

If instructed to execute multiple phases consecutively, skip the pause until the last phase.

## If You Get Stuck

When something isn't working as expected:
- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code
- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the outline was written
- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance


REMEMBER YOU MUST READ ALL THE NN-research-* and NN-design-* NN-prd-* NN-tdd-* FILES TO BUILD CONTEXT FOR THE WORK! good luck.

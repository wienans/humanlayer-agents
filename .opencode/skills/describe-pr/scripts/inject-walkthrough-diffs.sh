# inject-walkthrough-diffs.sh — fill a PR walkthrough's #diffs stash deterministically.
#
# The model writes the walkthrough HTML with `diffFile: "<path>"` on each file node
# and an EMPTY stash:
#
#     <div id="diffs" hidden>
#     </div>
#
# This script then reads every `diffFile:` path out of the NODES, pulls each file's
# raw hunk from `git diff` (or `gh pr diff`), and rewrites the stash so each path
# gets a `<script type="text/plain" data-diff="<path>">…</script>` block — flush-left,
# with any literal `</script>` rewritten as `<\/script>` so the renderer restores it.
#
# Why a script: the diff never has to pass through the model's context just to land
# in a file. The model decides WHICH files to inline (via diffFile); the bytes are
# injected here.
#
# Idempotent: it replaces the entire contents of <div id="diffs" hidden>…</div> each
# run, so re-running after editing nodes just refreshes the stash.
#
# Usage:
#   inject-walkthrough-diffs.sh <target.html> [base-dir] [options]
#
#   <target.html>     the walkthrough file to rewrite (edited in place)
#   [base-dir]        directory to run git/gh in — use this when the walkthrough
#                     lives in dir1 but the diff comes from ../dir2 (default: .)
#
# Options:
#   --base-dir DIR    same as the positional base-dir
#   --pr NUMBER       source the diff from `gh pr diff NUMBER` instead of git
#   --range REV       git revision range (default: main...HEAD)
#   --max-lines N     truncate any single file's hunk to N lines + an elision note
#                     (default: 0 = unlimited; use for lockfile-style files)
#   -h, --help        show this help
#
# Examples:
#   inject-walkthrough-diffs.sh pr-walkthrough.html --range main...HEAD
#   inject-walkthrough-diffs.sh pr-1527-walkthrough.html /tmp/pr1527 --pr 1527
#   inject-walkthrough-diffs.sh ../task/pr-walkthrough.html ../../synclayer --range upstream/main...HEAD

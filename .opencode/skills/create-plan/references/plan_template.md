# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan

## Overview

[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]

## Current State Analysis

[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]

### Key Discoveries:
- [Important finding with file:line reference]
- [Pattern to follow]
- [Constraint to work within]

## Desired End State

[A specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]

## What We're NOT Doing

[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]

## Implementation Approach

[High-level strategy and reasoning]

## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]

### Overview
[What this phase accomplishes]

### Changes Required:

#### 1.1 [Component/File Group]

**File**: `path/to/file.ext`
**Changes**: [Summary of changes] - [around line X | add after Y | etc etc]

```diff
// Specific code to add/modify
+ export function [name]() {
     // existing logic...
+    [code changes to make]
+
+ }

export interface [name]{
   // existing fiels (a, b, c, d, e)
+  [new fields to add]
+  [new fields to add]
}
```


#### 1.2 [Another Component/File Group]

**File**: `path/to/file.ext`
**Changes**: [Summary of changes]

...

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] [Migration applies cleanly: `bun run ...`]
- [ ] [Lint and format pass: `bun run quality`]
- [ ] [Tests pass: `bun run test`]
- [ ] [other automated verification as appropriate: curl, sql queries, etc]

<optional if="manual validation relevant">
#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] [manual step 1]
- [ ] [manual step 2]
- [ ] [manual step 3]

**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase.

## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]

### Overview
[What this phase accomplishes]

### Changes Required:

#### 2.1 [Component/File Group]

**File**: `path/to/file.ext`
**Changes**: [Summary of changes]

### Success Criteria:

[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]
